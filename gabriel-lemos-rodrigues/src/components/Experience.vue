                >> Worked on a research focused search engine that deeply analyzes
                research papers with the goal of presenting the most detailed breakdown
                of documents as possible<br><br>
                >> Made lexical analysis of research documents and extraction of 
                lexical data with <b>Elasticsearch and Vue.js</b><br><br>
                >> Greatly improved the visualization of data by creating
                components with <b>Vuejs and D3.js</b><br><br>
                >> All code was reviewed, perfected and shipped to production
