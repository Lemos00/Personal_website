            Hey there! <br /> <br />
            I'm Gabriel, an international student from Brazil @ <a href="https://www.uwo.ca/">Western University</a>.
            I'm currently on the second year of my Computer Science degree. <br /> <br />
            People always ask me: "Why did you leave Brazil to study in Canada?". When I first arrived in Canada, my answer to that question was that
            I wanted to develop my english skills and get to know another culture other than my own. As time went by, my answer 
            changed. My stay in Canada also made me realise how important one's culture is for decision making and our choices in life, and I wanted to explore more
            of that.<br /><br />
            As I wanted to go into CS from the start of my journey, Canada's "tech culture" was also a huge factor in this decision. I couldn't imagine how coding and
            events such as hackathons could be such a big thing among students before coming here.<br /><br />
            All of these factors made me see how great doing University outside of Brazil could be. So, I made my decision and decided to stay. I wanted to experience the best
            of the computer science world while also being able to apply that knowledge elsewhere, so I chose Western as my University. By applying the knowledge I acquire
            while going to hackathons, making projects and studying for my classes, I can go beyond what my academics can offer by themselves, meaning that I can strive for the
            very best of this field while also being as social as I can, and this is exactly what I want for my career. <br /><br />
            This Year, I will have the pleasure of being a "year-long" orientation leader in residence at Western. I will be a mentor for
            first years and help them go through their transition from Highschool to University the "smoothest" way possible. Being a mentor
            means more than just helping them with their problems. It means that you are a refence for that major/field that you study. This
            is also a reason why I chose to get into this position, as it will make me develop myself even more both technically and socially,
            making me reach even farther within the CS world and always strive for the best.<br /><br />
